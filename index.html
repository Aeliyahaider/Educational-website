            Main article: Definitions of education
            Numerous definitions of education have been suggested 
            by theorists belonging to diverse fields.[6][7][8]
             Many agree that education is a purposeful activity
              directed at achieving certain aims, especially the 
              transmission of knowledge.[9] But they often include 
              other aims as well, such as fostering skills and 
              character traits.[9][6][10] However, there are deep
               disagreements about the exact nature of education 
               besides these general characteristics. According 
               to some conceptions, it is primarily a process that 
               occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and
                learning.</p>

        <p class="sctionsubtag tex-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at
             achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge
              or fostering skills and character traits. These aims
               may include the development of understanding, 
               rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various
                researchers emphasize the role of critical
                 thinking in order to distinguish education 
                 from indoctrination. Some theorists require
                  that education results in an improvement of
                   the student while others prefer a value-neutral 
                   definition of the term. In a slightly different
                    sense, education may also refer, not to the
                     process, but to the product of this process:
                      the mental states and dispositions possessed 
                      by educated people..</p>

        <p class="sctionsubtag tex-small">Types of education are 
            commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal
             education. Formal education takes place in education
              and training institutions, is usually structured 
               curricular aims and objectives, and learning is
                typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, 
                formal education is compulsory up to a certain 
                 and commonly divided into educational stages such
                  as kindergarten, primary school and secondary 
                  school. Nonformal education occurs as addition</p>
